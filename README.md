# Multipurpose Human Surveillance System

The aim is to make a device which can improve the scope of currently available surveillance systems.Using face recognition techniques i am trying to make portable system which can work for both public and domestic surveillance.

for example :
  you can set the device for house hold surveillance in which it can identify if the person belongs to the family or not, it will serve as a good security system.
  also
  In a public place this device can recognize a person and check whether he has any criminal records on the database
